# What is this?

I tried my hands at programming in Rust. This is supposedly a "ransomware" but it's not functional at all. I'd say please don't use this for nefarious reasons, but given the state of this, please don't use it __at all__, as currently it only has the potential to fuck shit up, and nothing more.

As far as I remember this was only successfully encrypting/decrypting text files, not binaries or images, or anything remotely useful for that matter.
